## Description
The idea for sprout originated from a need of organizing my many goals into a fun, satisfying way. I wanted to create this app to be reward based as well as adding a calming aesthetic to the stress of managing all of my goals. Adding a reward of growing plants as you complete the steps was a way to add that reward and add a unique take on the traditional goal keeping app.
## Setup/Installation
1. Download or clone the repository:<br>
`git clone https://github.com/torikak11/sprout.git`
2. Run `npm install` in the folder to install dependencies
3. Start the development server by running:<br>
`npx expo start` or `npx expo start --tunnel`
4. Run the app on one of the following:<br>
    1. An Android or IOS simulator on your desktop
    2. The Expo Go app on your mobile device

For more information on running the app with Expo, see the docs https://docs.expo.dev/

## Credits
Many docs, tutorials, and youtube videos have helped bring this project where it is today, but I would like to credit [notJust.dev](https://www.youtube.com/@notjustdev) for helping me understand the concepts of React Native more clearly.
