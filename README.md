## Description
The idea for sprout originated from a need of organizing my many goals into a fun, satisfying way. I wanted to create this app to be reward based as well as adding a calming aesthetic to the stress of managing all of my goals. Adding a reward of growing plants as you complete the steps was a way to add that reward and add a unique take on the traditional goal keeping app.
